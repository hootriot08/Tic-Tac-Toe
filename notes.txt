HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME by the creator.
BIOPIC: I, Atharva Vaze, finished this game April 3rd of 2024.
How to play: 
1. All input is read with left click. 
2. The game opens to a menu where there are two buttons. I made the two player mode, but if anyone else wants to add on to this game file with a mode they created I created a button for it. 
3. After selecting two player mode, you play tic tac toe as normal.
4. after the game ends, it says who won. Then it gives the option to play again or to exit.
5. thats it, have fun.
